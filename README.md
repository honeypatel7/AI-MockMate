Provides instant feedback, ratings, and tailored suggestions to improve interview performance.


 
Project Overview: AI MockMate
AI MockMate is a complete AI-powered mock interview preparation platform. It helps users simulate real interview experiences by allowing them to choose a job role, description, experience level, and tech stack. Based on this, the app generates relevant interview questions and lets users record their responses via text, voice, or video.

Once an answer is recorded, the app uses Google Gemini AI to evaluate your response, give you a score, show the expected answer, and provide personalized feedback and recommendations. This makes it an excellent tool to practice, improve, and track your interview performance over time.
